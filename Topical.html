          If you use social media, log into one of your accounts and have a look at the advertisements. Can you trace them back to web pages 
          you have visited or posts you have interacted with? 
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first thing we in the group did in this task was to log in to one of us in the group's Instagram to see if any ads appear about 
          something we have come across in the past. After a while, ads appeared advertising for coding. This is interesting considering that in 
          recent weeks, coding related websites have been used very frequently for school. After some research through the advertising, we arrived 
          at the website w3schools. This is a website that is mainly about coding, and is a page that all of us in the group have used before. 
          After this, we moved on to the next person in the group's Instagram to see which ads appeared there. We came across several that were 
          about football and fantasy football, and when we went into more detail about the ads we came to a website again that is familiar to us, 
          and that we have been to before. The website is called Fantasy Premier League and is a page about fantasy football.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have noticed that after we started studying IT, we have received significant amounts of recommended code videos on Tiktok. 
          This appears regardless of whether we have searched for coding in Tiktok's search field. It is also experienced at times where someone 
          has talked about traveling abroad and then it has been announced to Trivago and other airlines afterwards. It creates a theory that 
          the phone is actively using the microphone to adapt ads, which is unexpected.

        <h3>
          Select one ethical dilemma from each of the videos in 6.4 and discuss it within your group.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the first video, Anne-Sofie Ris√•sen talks about the car that is about to crash. What is ethically correct in this situation, 
          for our part, would have been to drive into the wall to avoid more injuries. We interpret that to mean that the driver was inattentive, 
          and that he is the one who caused the situation that occurred. In front of him is a child who has no fault in this situation and was 
          supposed to pass the road. Next to the child walks a businessman who is out and about his everyday life. It is the driver's fault in 
          the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second video, Curt Rise talks about the human being unable to ignore the gender or ethnicity of the person speaking. 
          Ethically speaking, this is wrong because people should not be perceived differently by others considering something they cannot change. 
          We in the group believe that people evaluate others on a general basis, regardless of individual values, and this can be associated with 
          different cultures and which country they come from. People in different cultures can have perspectives on a topic and will naturally be 
          skeptical of others even when they have similar values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third video, Jutta Treviranus talks about when she was involved in a project to develop a driving assistant using artificial 
          intelligence. As we saw in the video, it didn't quite go according to plan. After some discussion among the group, we came to an ethical
          dilemma regarding the situation. Would it be ethically correct to continue the development of this type of Artificial Intelligence, 
          or is it correct to stop testing the technology completely. This comes after several attempts to adjust the function. 
          It did not get any better when it came to unconventional events that artificial intelligence is unable to calculate.
